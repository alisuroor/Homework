Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, and is the most widely used Java IDE.[6] It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages. Eclipse software development kit (SDK) is free and open-source software.
Installing Eclipse is relatively easy. Eclipse is a Java-based application and, as such, requires a Java runtime environment (JRE) in order to run.
5 Steps to Install Eclipse
1)Download Eclipse Installer from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads
2) For Windows users, after the Eclipse Installer executable has finished downloading it should be available in your download directory. Start the Eclipse Installer executable. You may get a security warning to run this file. If the Eclipse Foundation is the Publisher, you are good to select Run.
For Mac and Linux users, you will still need to unzip the download to create the Installer. Start the Installer once it is available.
3) The new Eclipse Installer shows the packages available to Eclipse users. You can search for the package you want to install or scroll through the list.Select and click on the package you want to install.(For this project select Eclipse IDE for Java developers)
4) Specify the folder where you want Eclipse to be installed. The default folder will be in your User directory .Select the ‘Install’ button to begin the installation.
5) Once the installation is complete you can now launch Eclipse. The Eclipse Installer has done it's work.

2)	Launch the Eclipse IDE & Create a Workspace.
3)	Right click on Project ‘Heal‘ > Select Properties > Java build path. Then navigate to Libraries tab and click Add External JARs.(JAR files downloaded from Step 1)
